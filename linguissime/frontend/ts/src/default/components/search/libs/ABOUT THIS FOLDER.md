# About this folder

This folder is indeed a bad decision in normal cases. But it would seem this is no normal case.

I tried importing Algolia and Algolia Helper through NPM, but the scripts did not appreciate.
The main file of each have trouble fetching the rest when it in folder+`index.js` format.

As a consequence, I will be using a standalone Algolia setup to spare myself some trouble and time.
